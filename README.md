# End-to-End Test Automation with Playwright and Allure

This project showcases an end-to-end automated test using Microsoft Playwright in combination with xUnit and Allure. It simulates a complete user journey on a test e-commerce website (Demo Blaze).

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **Playwright** (for browser automation)
- **xUnit** (test framework)
- **Allure** (for test reporting)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD pipeline)

## What the Test Does

The test will follow these steps to determine if an order can be made on the website:

**1.** Go to the website (https://demoblaze.com/)
**2.** Log in using a previously created account
**3.** Go to the cart and remove the items (if any) to make sure we are making a brand new order
**4.** Go back to the Home page
**5.** Select the "Phones" category
**6.** Click on the item "Nokia lumia 1520" and add it to the cart
**7.** Go back to the Home page
**8.** Select the "Phones" category
**9.** Scroll down, click on the item "HTC One M9" and add it to the cart
**10.** Go back to the Home page
**11.** Select the "Laptops" category
**12.** Click on the item "Sony vaio i7" and add it to the cart
**13.** Go back to the Home page
**14.** Select the "Laptops" category
**15.** Scroll down, click on the item "McBook Pro" and add it to the cart
**13.** Go back to the Home page
**14.** Select the "Monitors" category
**15.** Click on the item "Apple monitor 24" and add it to the cart
**16.** Go to the cart
**17.** Remove item "HTC One M9"
**18.** Remove item "McBook Pro"
**19.** Click on "Place Order"
**20.** Fill out the order form
**21.** Click on "Purchase"
**22.** Check if the message "Thank you for your purchase!" is displayed. If it is, the test passes; if not, it fails.

## Headless Mode - Important note

The test runs in **headless mode**, which means the browser operates in the background without a visible UI. This configuration was required for GitHub Actions to execute the test in the cloud environment.
To change this, go to the file "PlaywrightDriver.cs" in the "Drivers" folder and set the Headless option to false.

## Allure Report

You can view the full Allure report generated by the GitHub Actions pipeline here:

[**Click here to open the Allure report**](https://humber-ramos.github.io/Automation-CSharp-Playwright/)

The report includes:
- Test execution status
- Execution duration and environment details


## Additional Artifacts

The repository contains a folder named "Running the test (videos)" which was added to the root file for visibility. This file includes:
- A **video recording** of the test run
- Static **images of the Allure report**

This is useful for quick inspection without opening the full report.
Video is automatically generated when the test is run locally. To locate it, go here:
/bin/Debug/net9.0/videos
