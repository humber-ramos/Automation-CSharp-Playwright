# End-to-End Test Automation with Playwright and Allure

Available languages: [English](README.md) | [Español](README.es.md)<br>

This project showcases an end-to-end automated test using Microsoft Playwright in combination with xUnit and Allure. It simulates a complete user journey on a test e-commerce website (Demo Blaze).

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **Playwright** (for browser automation)
- **xUnit** (test framework)
- **Allure** (for test reporting)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD pipeline)

## What the Test Does

The test will follow these steps to determine if an order can be made on the website:

**1.** Go to the website (https://demoblaze.com/)<br>
**2.** Log in using a previously created account<br>
**3.** Go to the cart and remove the items (if any) to make sure we are making a brand new order<br>
**4.** Go back to the Home page<br>
**5.** Select the "Phones" category<br>
**6.** Click on the item "Nokia lumia 1520" and add it to the cart<br>
**7.** Go back to the Home page<br>
**8.** Select the "Phones" category<br>
**9.** Scroll down, click on the item "HTC One M9" and add it to the cart<br>
**10.** Go back to the Home page<br>
**11.** Select the "Laptops" category<br>
**12.** Click on the item "Sony vaio i7" and add it to the cart<br>
**13.** Go back to the Home page<br>
**14.** Select the "Laptops" category<br>
**15.** Scroll down, click on the item "McBook Pro" and add it to the cart<br>
**16.** Go back to the Home page<br>
**17.** Select the "Monitors" category<br>
**18.** Click on the item "Apple monitor 24" and add it to the cart<br>
**19.** Go to the cart<br>
**20.** Remove item "HTC One M9"<br>
**21.** Remove item "McBook Pro"<br>
**22.** Click on "Place Order"<br>
**23.** Fill out the order form<br>
**24.** Click on "Purchase"<br>
**25.** Check if the message "Thank you for your purchase!" is displayed. If it is, the test passes; if not, it fails.<br>
**26.** Log out

## Headless Mode - Important note

The test runs in **headless mode**, which means the browser operates in the background without a visible UI. This configuration was required for GitHub Actions to execute the test in the cloud environment.<br>
To change this, go to the file "PlaywrightDriver.cs" in the "Drivers" folder and set the Headless option to false.

## Allure Report

You can view the full Allure report generated by the GitHub Actions pipeline here:

[**Click here to open the Allure report**](https://humber-ramos.github.io/Automation-CSharp-Playwright/)

The report includes:
- Test execution status
- Execution duration and environment details


## Additional Artifacts

The repository contains a folder named "Running the test (videos)" which was added to the root file for visibility. This file includes:
- A **video recording** of the test run at regular speed and one with a 1.5-second delay (SlowMo)
- Static **images of the Allure report**

This is useful for quick inspection without opening the full report.<br>
Video is automatically generated when the test is run locally. To locate it, go here:<br>
/bin/Debug/net9.0/videos
